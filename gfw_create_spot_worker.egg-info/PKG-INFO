Description: # gfw-create-spot-worker
        CLI tool to create a spot worker on AWS and launch processes
        
        Used by GFW staff to create / manage spot instances. Default instance ID is updated frequently to point at our preferred analysis AMI, which includes GDAL, gmt, and other common OSGEO packages.
        
        Requires a `tokens` dir with .pem file to allow fab to enter the machine, in addition to proper AWS / EC2 permissions.
